  "question": "What are large language models and how do they work?",
  "question field": "Natural Language Processing Field",
  "final answer": "Large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are characterized by their vast size, often comprising billions of parameters, and are trained on extensive datasets to perform a wide range of NLP tasks with high accuracy and fluency. The text provides an overview of their architecture, training process, performance capabilities, examples, applications, comparison with smaller models, recent advancements, challenges, and future prospects."
